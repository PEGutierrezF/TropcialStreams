              <p class="lead">This course provides students with theoretical and applied knowledge on tropical stream ecology. Topics include channel morphology, water physicochemistry, biogeochemical cycling, and the structure and function of organisms that live in these ecosystems. I encourage students to read and critically discuss both "classical" and recent literature. We also discuss the current and future challenges to conservation and sustainable management of tropical streams. During the semester, we visit a few field sites to make observations and practice the methodologies that we discussed in class. These photos are from our last field trip to La Selva Biological Station, where students conducted a reaeration experiment in collaboration with Nick, a PhD student at NCSU.</p>
