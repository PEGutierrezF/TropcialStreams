              <p class="lead">The Streams Project has been studying tropical lowland streams in La Selva Biological Station for more than 30y. Our project has focused on identifying the most important variables affecting aquatic macroinvertebrates. Our findings have determined that large-scale variables such as ENSO, as well as local variables such as hydrology, are responsible for structuring the composition and diversity of aquatic macroinvertebrates.
We are currently interested in describing the long-term trends of macroinvertebrate assemblages. Our research questions focus on determining whether macroinvertebrate trajectories are convergent or divergent. Are the changes gradual or abrupt, and what is the magnitude of these changes?</p>
