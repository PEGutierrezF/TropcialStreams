# Distance Measures

1. The first step of most multivariate analyses is to calculate a matrix of distances or similarities among a set of items in a multidimensional space.[^one]

2. This is analogous to constructing the triangular "mileage chart" provided with many road maps.[^1]

# Distance Measures

- This first step is extremely important. If information is ignored in this step, then it cannot be expressed in the results.

- Likewise, if noise or outliers are exaggerated by the distance measure, then these unwanted features of our data will have undue influence on the results, perhaps obscuring meaningful patterns.
